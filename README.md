    <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto text-lg space-y-4">
      <p>Knight Waridi was born into a lineage of protectors, a secret family tradition passed down through the ages. Unbeknownst to him, his ancestors were once part of a mystical order known as the "Guardians of Hope," charged with safeguarding an ancient, hidden portal deep within Nairobi.</p>
      <p>One night, while exploring the hills, Knight stumbled upon an abandoned shrine. Drawn by strange energy, he found a pair of glowing shoes. As he touched them, an ancient spirit from the Shangos realm appeared, binding Knight to a new oath—become the protector of hope.</p>
      <p>Now, armed with gravity-defying shoes and a high-tech suit, Knight Waridi becomes Hopperman, the guardian of Nairobi and beyond.</p>
